A basic android application to connect to a server using Secure Socket Layer.

The folder : Server has a java file. 
Compile : javac Server.java
Deploy the server : java Server

The folder AndroidSSL is the android project. The apk is in bin folder.


If you run this combination of Server.java and AndroidSSL as Client, if you give the command as hello, the response would be Bingo. Else, it would be something else.
